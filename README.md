## “An Eye For the Blind”

The prototype that we plan on developing is aimed to be cost-effective and durable such that it is accessible to the bigger mass and can be used by everyone.
It is very crucial for visually challenged people to have proper aid so that they are not dependent on other people for their basic needs thus empowering them.
In this project, we have worked on a visual aid designed to be worn as an eye mask comprising vibrating motors and ultrasonic sensors that alert the user of any nearby obstacle.
