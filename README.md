## “An Eye For the Blind”

The prototype  is aimed to be cost-effective and durable such that it is accessible to the bigger mass and can be used by everyone.
It is very crucial for visually challenged people to have proper aid so that they are not dependent on other people for their basic needs thus empowering them.
In this project, we have worked on a visual aid designed to be worn as an eye mask comprising vibrating motors and ultrasonic sensors that alert the user of any nearby obstacle.

### Methodology & Observation:
The device integrated vibrating motors and ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and issue alerts when necessary. Utilizing high-frequency sound waves, the ultrasonic sensors identified nearby objects, and the vibration motors notified the user of detected obstacles, enhancing their ability to navigate safely in unfamiliar environments and avoid collisions.

### Result:
The proposed device will be a practical and reliable solution to help individuals who are visually impaired or blind navigate their surroundings with greater confidence and independence, providing alerts to the user while being designed with user comfort and convenience in mind.
